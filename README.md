# AI-Enabled Attendance System (SmartAttend)

An AI-powered attendance and notification platform designed to enhance child safety by automatically detecting a child’s arrival using facial recognition and notifying parents in real time.

This project is developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Programming (AIP)** course at the **University of Nairobi**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Ensuring the safety of school-going children after school hours remains a major concern for parents and guardians. Traditional methods of confirming a child’s safe arrival rely heavily on manual communication, which is often unreliable and prone to delays or human error.

The **AI-Enabled Attendance System (SmartAttend)** proposes an intelligent solution that leverages **computer vision and machine learning** to:

- Detect and recognize a child’s face using a camera
- Verify identity against registered facial data
- Record attendance automatically
- Send instant notifications to parents via email

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Provide **real-time notifications** to parents upon a child’s safe arrival
- Enhance **child safety** through automated identity verification
- Reduce dependence on manual reporting
- Improve trust and communication between parents, schools, and transport providers

---

## 👥 Users & Roles

- **Parents/Guardians** – Receive notifications and monitor attendance
- **School Administrators** – Manage students, registrations, and records
- **System Administrators/Developers** – Maintain and enhance the system
